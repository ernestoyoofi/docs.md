# Account has limitation or suspended

Most likely you have experienced reports from several people or owners, one of these such as your account name, username, profile picture, bio or page and posts.

The reason you are subject to restrictions is because you violate rules such as using inappropriate words, inappropriate content or media or not safe for work (NSFW) containing negative things including murder.

In addition, you post bad things that are not worthy or inappropriate to appear as a whole.
