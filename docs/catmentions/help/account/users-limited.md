# User Limited

Your account is limited because there are too many devices logged in at the same time or the same day, make sure you log in only 2 - 3 devices, also make sure to check your email to see who was the last to log in.

If the account logs out suddenly, also make sure your google account is only you and not someone else.

If it is still limited, try waiting 1 - 4 days after doing this or report [this problem to the owner](https://catmentions-webapi.vercel.app/report).
